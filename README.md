# ZOHO invoice php client

This is an attemps to integrate ZOHO invoice api ina  php library. This library rely on guzzle and guzzle service description feature.
It's very convenient to use that feature since it can validate your data from a json description schema (see guzzle doc).
I'v began to compile Zoho invoice api parameters in services file you can find in "Services > ServiceFolder > ServiceFile.json"

I won't continue this work since ZOHO invoice api finally lacks some features important to us, so feel free to fork and contribute if it can be helpful for you.
